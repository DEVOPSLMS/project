# Book Store E Commerce
Our Project is on sellings book online during this pandemic.



## Project Description
Our Web App allows our users to see different kinds of books that they can buy from online without the need to go down to our store and buy. This helps especially during this pandemic as Covid 19 has been spread all around the world, we are taking precautions to reduce contact between our customers and our workers.

Some of the challenges that we have faced is not implementing any advanced queries so in the future we hope to have that so that our customers can have a better time browisng our web app.


## How to get started

We have a bookstore.sql file that have all the information about our database such as table structure. From there all you have to do is import the files and start working on the project.
